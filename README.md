My first repository.

In order to identify a palindrome, I will first identify the starting and ending letters of the word. If they are the same, then I will look at the middle letter(s) of the word and see if they are the same. If both the starting and ending letters, and the middle letters and the same, I will read the word forwards and backward to see if they sound the same.
